                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Tradition One: "Our common welfare should come first..."</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> A unified digital system promotes our common welfare. When service information is stored in a central, secure Shared Drive instead of scattered across personal computers, we reduce the friction and disputes that can arise from lost information. This unity of information allows us to better serve our primary purpose.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Tradition Two: "...our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern."</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> Shared access to information supports the authority of the group conscience. When minutes, reports, and agendas are accessible to all relevant members in a Shared Drive, the group conscience is fully informed. This transparency ensures that decisions are guided by the group, not just the knowledge held by a single trusted servant.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Tradition Four: "Each group should be autonomous..."</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> The digital structure must mirror our principle of autonomy. By creating separate, independent Shared Drives for each Group, District, and Committee, we build a technical firewall. The members of one entity cannot access the private records of another, technically enforcing the autonomy that is essential to AA.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Tradition Seven: "...fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions."</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> This principle extends to the ownership of our "property," including our digital records. Storing service history in a group-owned Shared Drive—rather than an individual's personal drive—ensures the group is responsible for and in control of its own information. It prevents disputes and keeps the group self-sufficient.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Tradition Nine: "A.A., as such, ought never be organized..."</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> This tradition guides us to create "the least possible organization." In a digital context, this means we collect the least possible information required to do our service work. We don't need members' home addresses for a meeting list, but we may need a full name and phone number for a corrections roster to meet legal requirements. Tradition Nine reminds us to be disciplined and purposeful in what data we collect and store.</p>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Tradition Eleven: "Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion..."</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> This tradition governs how we present ourselves to the public. It means our public-facing websites and documents should be dignified and informative, never promotional. It sets the stage for Tradition Twelve by defining the line between our public message and our personal lives.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Tradition Twelve: "Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions..."</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> Tradition Twelve reminds us to practice humility and place principles before personalities. It applies differently inside and outside the fellowship. At the public level (press, radio, films, and public websites), we are anonymous. Within the fellowship, we must identify ourselves to do service work effectively. Our digital practices must respect this distinction.</p>
                    <div class="best-practice-card">
                        <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Data & Anonymity Best Practices:</h4>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Context is Key:</strong> For general minutes, a first name and last initial is sufficient. For internal service rosters (e.g., corrections or 12-step calls), full names, phone numbers, or emails may be required. This sensitive information must be stored with the highest level of security.</li>
                            <li><strong>Principle of Minimum Information:</strong> Only collect what is absolutely necessary. For example, a member's suburb may be useful for coordinating PI/PA work, but their full street address is not.</li>
                            <li><strong>Be Mindful of Legal Requirements:</strong> When handling rosters with personal data, be aware of and adhere to local privacy legislation (like the Australian Privacy Act).</li>
                            <li><strong>"Share with Link" Cautiously:</strong> This option should only be used for fully public, non-sensitive information, such as a flyer for an open event. It should never be used for documents containing member information or internal business.</li>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Concept IV: Participation</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> Shared digital access encourages participation. When a committee chair shares a draft agenda in Google Docs and gives members "commenter" access, every member has the opportunity to review materials and contribute their thoughts before a meeting. This leads to a more engaged and effective group conscience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Concept V: Right of Appeal</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> A complete and accessible digital record upholds the Right of Appeal. If a minority feels their viewpoint has been disregarded, a clear, searchable history of minutes and motions in a Shared Drive provides a transparent record of all past decisions. This accountability is essential for fairness.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Concept IX: Leadership</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> Good leaders need good information. By preserving our service history, we provide incoming trusted servants with the context and background of past decisions. A new DCM can review the last year's minutes to understand ongoing issues, allowing them to provide "sound and well-thought-out" leadership from day one, rather than starting from zero.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Warranty Two: Prudent Financial Reserve</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> Financial prudence and transparency are linked. A treasurer who maintains a live budget in a Google Sheet within a Shared Drive provides the committee with a constant, clear view of its financial situation. This supports the group's ability to maintain a prudent reserve and make responsible financial decisions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Warranty Six: No Unqualified Authority</h3>
                    <p class="text-body"><strong>Digital Application:</strong> The principle of "least privilege" is a digital expression of this warranty. By assigning permissions carefully (Viewer, Commenter, Contributor, Manager), we ensure that no single member is placed in a position of unqualified authority over all information. Access is a shared responsibility, tailored to the needs of each service role.</p>
