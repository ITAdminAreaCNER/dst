                <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
                    <p class="mb-4">The Google Workspace license is held by the Area, and an Area IT Administrator has the highest level of technical access. It is vital to understand this role correctly.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
                        <li>The IT Administrator is a <strong class="text-header">custodian of the infrastructure</strong>, not a supervisor of content. Their role is purely technical, guided by the Area Committee.</li>
                        <li>Their access exists to perform essential tasks: create new Shared Drives, manage top-level security settings, provide technical support, and ensure the system's overall health.</li>
                        <li>They <strong class="text-header">do not govern</strong> <strong><em>(Tradition Two)</em></strong>. They operate under the direction of the Area Committee and do not access the content of any drive unless specifically requested for technical recovery purposes, with the full knowledge of the drive's members.</li>
                        <li>This structure balances the need for centralized technical administration with the spiritual principle of <strong class="text-header">autonomy for each service entity</strong> <strong><em>(Tradition Four)</em></strong>.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-header mb-6 border-b-2 pb-2">The Shared Drive Manager (Local Responsibility)</h2>
                <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border-l-4 accent-border">
                    <p class="mb-4">Once the IT Administrator creates a Shared Drive and assigns a "Manager" (e.g., a Committee Chair, DCM, or other trusted servant), the day-to-day responsibility for that drive is delegated to the local service entity. The Drive Manager is accountable to their group conscience.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Their key responsibilities are a practical application of our Traditions and Concepts:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
                        <li><strong class="text-header">Membership Management:</strong> The Manager is responsible for adding new members and removing outgoing members in a timely manner. This ensures that only current trusted servants have access to the group's information, protecting both security and the group's autonomy.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-header">Applying "Least Privilege" <em>(Warranty Six)</em>:</strong> The Manager must thoughtfully assign permissions. Most members only need "Viewer" or "Contributor" access. This prevents accidental deletions and ensures no member has unqualified authority over the group's records.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-header">Upholding Anonymity <em>(Tradition Twelve)</em>:</strong> The Manager is the first line of defense in protecting anonymity. They should guide the group to ensure that sensitive personal information is handled with care and is not stored in documents intended for wider sharing.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-header">Facilitating Participation <em>(Concept IV)</em>:</strong> By ensuring all members have the correct access to agendas, minutes, and reports, the Manager helps create an informed group conscience where all can participate fully.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-header">Ensuring Continuity <em>(Concept IX)</em>:</strong> The Manager's primary role is to be the custodian of their group's information, ensuring it is well-organized and preserved for the trusted servants who will follow them.</li>
