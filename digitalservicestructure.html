                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-header mb-4">The Core Challenge: No Restricted Sub-folders</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">The most important technical detail to understand about Google Shared Drives is that you <strong class="text-red-600">cannot restrict access to a sub-folder</strong>. If a member has access to a Shared Drive, they have access to every folder and file within it.</p>
                    <p>This means we must be thoughtful and strategic when we design our digital filing cabinet to protect sensitive information while ensuring members have the access they need. Here are two effective strategies.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-header mb-6 border-b-2 pb-2">Strategy 1: The Federated Drive Model (Recommended)</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">This model provides the best balance of security and autonomy and is the recommended approach for most service bodies. The core idea is that <strong>each service entity with a distinct purpose or level of confidentiality gets its own independent Shared Drive.</strong></p>
                
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">General Service Drives</h4>
                    <p class="text-body">These drives are for the day-to-day business of a service body, accessible to all its members.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                        <li>An <strong>Area</strong> has its main Shared Drive for general business (e.g., assembly minutes, area committee reports). All Area Committee members would have access.</li>
                        <li>Each <strong>District</strong> has its own Shared Drive, completely separate from the Area and other Districts. All GSRs and officers of that District would have access.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Dedicated Subcommittee Drives (For Sensitive Information)</h4>
                    <p class="text-body">This is the crucial step for protecting privacy. Subcommittees that handle sensitive information should have their own separate, highly restricted Shared Drives.</p>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                        <li>A <strong>Corrections Committee</strong> would have its own Shared Drive. Only the members of that committee would have access, protecting the privacy of institutional contacts and volunteer rosters.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>Finance Committee</strong> or <strong>Area Treasury</strong> would have its own Shared Drive. Access would be limited to the treasurer and finance committee members to protect detailed financial records.</li>
                         <li>A <strong>12-Step Call List Committee</strong> would have its own highly secure Shared Drive, with access restricted to only those trusted servants who manage the call list.</li>

                        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Principle:</strong> "Each group should be autonomous..."</p>
                        <p><strong>How it Works:</strong> The Federated Model is a direct application of this principle. By giving each District and sensitive Committee its own separate Shared Drive, we create a technical firewall. The members of "District 1" cannot see the files in "District 2." This guarantees the autonomy of each service entity.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">Tradition Seven: Self-Support</h3>
                        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Principle:</strong> "Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting..."</p>
                        <p><strong>How it Works:</strong> By using Shared Drives, the service entity (the District, the Committee) "owns" its own records. This prevents disputes over property and ensures the group's information remains self-contained and secure, independent of any single member.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">For some service bodies or specific projects, it may be preferable not to grant broad access to an entire drive. Instead, access is granted only to specific folders or individual documents as needed.</p>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-header mb-2">How It Works</h4>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                        <li>A committee might use a private, unlisted Google Site as its main hub or "dashboard."</li>
                        <li>On this site, the chair can embed links to specific documents (like the current agenda) or folders (like the "Minutes Archive") from a Shared Drive.</li>
                        <li>Members are given access to view the Google Site, and the permissions on the individual files/folders determine what they can see or edit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> This offers very tight, item-by-item control over who sees what. It can be useful for ad-hoc working groups or special projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consideration:</strong> This model requires more administrative effort from the chair or secretary to manage all the individual sharing links and permissions. It can become complex if many documents are involved.</li>

                         <li><strong>Tradition Four (Autonomy):</strong> Autonomy is protected by controlling access to the links on the private Google Site. Even if documents live in the same Shared Drive, members of one group are not given the links to another group's documents.</li>
                         <li><strong>Tradition Seven (Self-Support):</strong> This is upheld because the underlying documents and folders themselves are still owned by the group in a Shared Drive. The Google Site is just a "dashboard" of links; the data itself remains the property of the service entity.</li>
